  You're a secret agent and you've finally found the program with info for your next mission!
  Problem is, you need to identify yourself at `nc acmcyber.com 10104` and forgot how :(
  Can you figure out your identification code and get your info back?
  Feel free to run on SEASnet if you can't run it locally.
